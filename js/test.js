/*
Sum of positive
8kyu

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

/*
Opposite number
8kyu

Very simple, given a number, find its opposite.

Examples:

1: -1
14: -14
-34: 34
But can you do it in 1 line of code and without any conditionals?


*/





/*
String Rpeat
8kyu

Write a function called repeatStr which repeats the given string string exactly n times.

repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"
*/




/*
Remove First and Last Character
8kyu

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the
first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string.
You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

*/


/*
Return Negative
8kyu

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative.
But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
Notes:

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

*/

/*
Find the smallest integer in and array
8kyu

Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

/*
Counting Sheep
8kyu

Consider an array of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need
a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
The correct answer would be 17.

Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined
